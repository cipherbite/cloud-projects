## Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables you to define, manage, and provision infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files. Key benefits include:

- **Consistency:** Achieve reliable, repeatable deployments.
- **Version Control:** Track and manage infrastructure changes with ease.
- **Scalability:** Automate the provisioning process, minimizing manual errors and boosting efficiency.

## Advantages of Terraform

Terraform, a premier IaC tool, offers the following advantages:

- **Declarative Configuration Language:** Define your desired infrastructure state clearly and concisely.
- **State Management:** Efficiently track and manage resource states across deployments.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Seamlessly provision infrastructure across various cloud providers.
- **Rich Ecosystem and Community:** Leverage extensive documentation and community-driven resources.

## Project Scope and Goals

### Infrastructure Components

In this project, we will provision the following AWS resources:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
- **Subnet**
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
- **Route Table**
- **EC2 Instance**

### Tools and Technology

To execute this project, you will need:

- **Terraform CLI**
- **AWS CLI**
- **An AWS Account**

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing Terraform

To start, install Terraform by following the [official installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for your operating system.

### Configuring AWS Credentials

Next, configure your AWS credentials to enable Terraform to interact with AWS services. Use the command below to set up your AWS access key ID and secret access key:

```sh
aws configure
```

[![aws-configure.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tCS0xk70/aws-configure.png)](https://postimg.cc/1fqYxppM)

As per the image above, you will be prompted to type your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, and Default output format.

Verify the configuration by running:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

*Ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured to enable Terraform to interact seamlessly with AWS services.*

## Terraform Configuration

### `main.tf`

The `main.tf` file serves as the foundation of your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) project in Terraform. This file is the primary configuration file where you declaratively define the desired state of your cloud resources. It meticulously outlines the components of your infrastructure architecture, acting as the blueprint for your deployment:

[![main-tf.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rsGVTr9V/main-tf.png)](https://postimg.cc/4HdkbnMq)

**Explanation:**
- **Provider Block:** Configures the AWS provider with a specific region using the variable `aws_region`. This ensures that all resources are created in the defined region.
- **Resource Block:** Defines an EC2 instance with the specified Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type, both of which are parameterized using variables for flexibility and reusability.

### `variables.tf`

The `variables.tf` file is the Swiss Army knife of your Terraform configuration. It empowers you to define and manage variables, making your infrastructure code adaptable, reusable, and easy to maintain. This modularity allows for a cleaner and more organized codebase:

[![variable-tf.png](https://i.postimg.cc/t44q07nb/variable-tf.png)](https://postimg.cc/1fbhwmK7)

**Explanation:**
- **Variable Definitions:** Facilitate parameterization and reuse across your Terraform configurations. 
- **Example Variables:** 
  - `aws_region`: Defines the AWS region for deploying resources. Default is set to `eu-west-1` but can be overridden.
  - `ami_id`: Specifies the AMI ID for the EC2 instance, making it customizable.
  - `instance_type`: Specifies the type of EC2 instance, with a default value of `t2.micro`.

### `terraform.tfvars`

The `terraform.tfvars` file is a key component in Terraform's configuration management. It acts as a centralized store for the values assigned to the variables declared in your Terraform code. Externalizing these values provides several advantages:

- **Flexibility:** Easily modify infrastructure parameters without directly altering your main configuration files.
- **Customization:** Tailor your infrastructure to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) by simply switching out the `terraform.tfvars` file.
- **Security:** Keep sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, separate from your core configuration.
- **Maintainability:** Improve code organization and readability by separating variable declarations from their assigned values.

[![terraform-tfvars.png](https://i.postimg.cc/jdsKNCXf/terraform-tfvars.png)](https://postimg.cc/hh3HRDN4)

**Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** Simplifies configuration by providing default values for variables, making your configurations more modular and easier to manage.
- **Example Values:** Sets default values for the AWS region (`us-west-2`), AMI ID (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`), and instance type (`t2.micro`).

### `output.tf`

The `output.tf` file serves as a communication channel between your Terraform configuration and the outside world. It defines the specific information about your created resources that you want Terraform to display upon successful provisioning. This file is crucial for retrieving resource attributes that might be needed for further configurations or integrations:

[![output-tf.png](https://i.postimg.cc/bN3PR8CB/output-tf.png)](https://postimg.cc/XpGtjM0f)

**Explanation:**
- **Output Blocks:** Each block specifies an output value that Terraform will display after the infrastructure is created. This is useful for getting key resource attributes for further use.
  - `instance_id`: Outputs the ID of the created EC2 instance.
  - `instance_public_ip`: Outputs the public IP address of the created EC2 instance.

By organizing your Terraform configuration into these distinct files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`, and `output.tf`), you achieve a modular, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure setup. This structure not only makes your code more readable and easier to manage but also enhances its flexibility and reusability across different environments and use cases.

## Applying and Managing Changes

### Initialize

Initialize your Terraform configuration with the following command:

```sh
terraform init
```

*The `terraform init` command sets up the working directory containing the configuration files, initializing any necessary plugins.*

### Apply

To apply the configuration and create the defined resources, use:

```sh
terraform apply
```
Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

*The `terraform apply` command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.*

### Validate

It's good practice to validate your configuration files to ensure that the configuration is syntactically correct:

```sh
terraform validate
```

*The `terraform validate` command checks the syntax and validity of the configuration files.*

### Plan

Generate and review an execution plan to understand what changes Terraform will make:

```sh
terraform plan
```

This step is optional but recommended to ensure changes align with your expectations before applying them.

*The `terraform plan` command creates an execution plan, allowing you to preview the actions that will be taken when you apply the configuration.*

## Cleaning Up: Destroying Infrastructure

To remove the infrastructure previously created by Terraform, run:

```sh
terraform destroy
```

*The `

terraform destroy` command terminates and removes all resources defined in the configuration files.*

## Conclusion

This hands-on project provided a practical introduction to using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). You learned to:

1. **Install and configure Terraform and AWS CLI.**
2. **Set up Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`, `output.tf`).**
3. **Apply and manage infrastructure changes.**
4. **Clean up resources by destroying the infrastructure.**

Terraformâ€™s powerful declarative language and state management capabilities make it an essential tool for efficient, scalable, and consistent cloud infrastructure management.
