## Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables you to define, manage, and provision infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files. Key benefits include:

- **Consistency:** Achieve reliable, repeatable deployments.
- **Version Control:** Track and manage infrastructure changes with ease.
- **Scalability:** Automate the provisioning process, minimizing manual errors and boosting efficiency.

## Advantages of Terraform

Terraform, a premier IaC tool, offers the following advantages:

- **Declarative Configuration Language:** Define your desired infrastructure state in a clear and concise manner.
- **State Management:** Efficiently track and manage resource states across deployments.
- **Multi-Provider Support:** Seamlessly provision infrastructure across various cloud providers.
- **Rich Ecosystem and Community:** Leverage extensive documentation and community-driven resources.

## Project Scope and Goals

### Infrastructure Components

In this project, we will provision the following AWS resources:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**
- **Subnet**
- **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
- **Route Table**
- **EC2 Instance**

### Tools and Technology

To execute this project, you will need:

- **Terraform CLI**
- **AWS CLI**
- **An AWS Account**

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing Terraform

To start, install Terraform by following the [official installation guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for your operating system.

### Configuring AWS Credentials

Next, configure your AWS credentials to enable Terraform to interact with AWS services. Use the command below to set up your AWS access key ID and secret access key:

```sh
aws configure
```

Verify the configuration by running:

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

*Ensure that your AWS credentials are correctly configured to enable Terraform to interact seamlessly with AWS services.*

## Terraform Configuration

### `main.tf`

The `main.tf` file is the core configuration file where you define your infrastructure resources. Below is a sample configuration:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}
```

![main.tf](placeholder-for-screenshot)

**Explanation:**
- **Provider Block:** Configures the AWS provider with a specific region.
- **Resource Block:** Defines an EC2 instance with the specified AMI and instance type.

### `variables.tf`

The `variables.tf` file declares variables to make your configuration more flexible and reusable:

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region to deploy resources"
  type        = string
  default     = "eu-west-1"
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "The AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The instance type for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}
```

![variables.tf](placeholder-for-screenshot)

**Explanation:**
- **Variable Definitions:** Facilitate parameterization and reuse across configurations.
- **Example Variables:** Define the AWS region, AMI ID, and instance type.

### `terraform.tfvars`

The `terraform.tfvars` file holds the values for variables:

```hcl
aws_region    = "us-west-2"
ami_id        = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

![terraform.tfvars](placeholder-for-screenshot)

**Explanation:**
- **Purpose:** Simplifies configuration by providing default values for variables.
- **Example Values:** Sets default values for the AWS region, AMI ID, and instance type.

### `output.tf`

The `output.tf` file defines the outputs that Terraform will display after creating resources:

```hcl
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

![output.tf](placeholder-for-screenshot)

**Explanation:**
- **Outputs:** Display important information about the resources, such as the EC2 instance ID and public IP address.

## Applying and Managing Changes

### Initialize

Initialize your Terraform configuration with the following command:

```sh
terraform init
```

![Terraform Init](placeholder-for-screenshot)

*The `terraform init` command sets up the working directory containing the configuration files, initializing any necessary plugins.*

### Apply

To apply the configuration and create the defined resources, use:

```sh
terraform apply
```
Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

![Terraform Apply](placeholder-for-screenshot)

*The `terraform apply` command applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration.*

### Validate

It's good practice to validate your configuration files. This ensures that the configuration is syntactically correct:

```sh
terraform validate
```

![Terraform Validate](placeholder-for-screenshot)

*The `terraform validate` command checks the syntax and validity of the configuration files.*

### Plan

Generate and review an execution plan to understand what changes Terraform will make:

```sh
terraform plan
```

This step is optional but recommended to ensure changes align with your expectations before applying them.

![Terraform Plan](placeholder-for-screenshot)

*The `terraform plan` command creates an execution plan, allowing you to preview the actions that will be taken when you apply the configuration.*

### Cleaning Up: Destroying Infrastructure

To remove the infrastructure previously created by Terraform, run:

```sh
terraform destroy
```

![Terraform Destroy](placeholder-for-screenshot)

*The `terraform destroy` command terminates and removes all resources defined in the configuration files.*

## Conclusion

This hands-on project provided a practical introduction to using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). You learned to:

1. **Install and configure Terraform and AWS CLI.**
2. **Set up Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`, `output.tf`).**
3. **Apply and manage infrastructure changes.**
4. **Clean up resources by destroying the infrastructure.**

Terraformâ€™s powerful declarative language and state management capabilities make it an essential tool for efficient, scalable, and consistent cloud infrastructure management.
